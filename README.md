# NYT-Scraper :statue_of_liberty:

This is a fullstack MERN web application that crawls the New York Times website and allows users to search for and save articles based on a query.

The application is deployed on heroku [here](https://quiet-beach-74728.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started :city_sunset:

### Prerequisites :open_file_folder:
You will need both `node` and `yarn` installed on your computer in order to run this app. You can find out more about `yarn` at their [official site.](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Installation :file_folder:
Inside your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the location of the cloned repo. Install the necessary dependencies by running either - 
```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn install
```
after the dependencies have been installed run
```
yarn start
```
to intialize the app. It will launch the application at `http://localhost:3000` and you are now ready to search for random New York Times articles

### mongoDB :herb:
In order for the app to render locally, you will need to have mongoDB installed on your computer. Depending on your operating system, the installation proccess will be different. You can find more info on installing mongoDB through their documentation.
